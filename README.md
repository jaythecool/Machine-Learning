## Linear Regression

### Description
Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

### Use Case
- Predicting house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, etc.
- Forecasting sales based on historical data.

### Sample Dataset
- [House Prices Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## Logistic Regression

### Description
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems. It models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables.

### Use Case
- Spam detection in emails.
- Predicting whether a customer will buy a product.

### Sample Dataset
- [Customer Purchase Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## Decision Trees

### Description
Decision Trees are used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features.

### Use Case
- Classifying species of plants based on their features.
- Predicting customer churn.

### Sample Dataset
- [Iris Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## Random Forest

### Description
Random Forest is an ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Use Case
- Credit scoring.
- Predicting stock prices.

### Sample Dataset
- [Credit Scoring Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Description
Support Vector Machines are used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.

### Use Case
- Image classification.
- Text categorization.

### Sample Dataset
- [Handwritten Digits Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Description
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.

### Use Case
- Recommender systems.
- Anomaly detection.

### Sample Dataset
- [Recommender System Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## K-Means Clustering

### Description
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters).

### Use Case
- Market segmentation.
- Image compression.

### Sample Dataset
- [Market Segmentation Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Description
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible.

### Use Case
- Reducing the dimensionality of image data.
- Preprocessing for other machine learning algorithms.

### Sample Dataset
- [Wine Quality Dataset](path/to/dataset)

## Neural Networks

### Description
Neural Networks are a set of algorithms modeled after the human brain that are designed to recognize patterns. They are used for complex pattern recognition tasks.

### Use Case
- Image and speech recognition.
- Natural language processing.

### Sample Dataset
- [MNIST Handwritten Digits](path/to/dataset)

## Gradient Boosting

### Description
Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially, each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.

### Use Case
- Predicting customer churn.
- Fraud detection.

### Sample Dataset
- [Fraud Detection Dataset](path/to/dataset)
